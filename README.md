## Introduction into Probabilistic Topic Modelling

### Probabilistic Topic Models

Topic models are probabilistic models for uncovering the semantic structure of an unstructured document collection based on a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of the original texts. They can organize the collection according to the discovered main themes.
Topic modeling algorithms can be adapted to many kinds of data. Among other applications, they have been used to find patterns in email, genetic data, scientific abstracts, images, and social networks.

Those algorithms can be applied to massive collections of documents and at present we already have the tools to analyze streaming collections, like you might find from a Web API.

Here we will briefly show a basic use of the python topic modelling library Gensim.
